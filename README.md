### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this countdown timer and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle
